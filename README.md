# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
* Description: Test the blue section will show "Database query failded", and others will redirect the page. The test I used is '''?id=' OR 1=1'--'''

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
* Description: Login to he blue section, change it to public/hacktools/change_session_id.php to get the session ID. Then open another brower to change the session ID. You will automatically login

## Green

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery
* Description: When I try to change the username in the edit section. I change the value of csrd_token. Only the red section works.

## Bonus Objective 2: Build on Objective #4 (Cross-Site Scripting)
* Descrption: In the green feedback section, I used <script>document.location="https://www.facebook.com"</script> and when I click feedback it will direct to google page.
